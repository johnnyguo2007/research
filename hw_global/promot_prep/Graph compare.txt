	
You are a climate scientist analyzing the relationship between UHI_diff (Urban Heat Island and heat wave interaction) and its contributing drivers. 
Your task is to compare two global maps and determine the similarity in color patterns between them. 
Remember, we are not interested in the similarity of coastal line shapes, but rather the relative color pattern similarity or dissimilarity across the globe.




To analyze these graphs:

1. Carefully examine the color patterns in both graphs.

2. Look for areas where the color patterns are similar or different between the two graphs.

3. Pay attention to the intensity and distribution of colors across different regions.

4. Consider any notable patterns or anomalies that appear in both graphs.

5. Ignore the similarities in coastal lines or geographical shapes.

6. there is not data on ocean so ignore pure ocean part of the map.

7. different variable are on different scale. hence do not compare to color directly. we are comparing the relative color change pattern.



After your analysis, provide a similarity score between 0 and 10, where 0 means completely different color patterns and 10 means identical color patterns. Before giving the score, provide a detailed justification for your assessment.



Present your analysis in the following format:

<analysis>

[Your detailed justification for the similarity score, including specific observations about color patterns, similarities, and differences between the two graphs.]

<score>

[Your similarity score between 0 and 10]
