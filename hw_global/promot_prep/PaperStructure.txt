Topic
Global Spatial Analysis of Interactions between Urban Heat Islands and Heat Waves 


Abstract 
Heat waves (HWs) significantly threaten public health. The extreme heat risk is particularly relevant to urban residents due to urban heat island (UHI) and its synergetic interactions with HWs in some cities. Previous research on the interactions between UHI and HWs has focused on a single city or region, and both positive and negative interactions have been reported. The global patterns of the interactions between UHI and HWs across various climate background and their underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we simulate the global UHI from 1985 to 2013 using the Community Land Model (CLM). By conducting a global-scale analysis of interactions between UHI and HWs, we reveal their spatial and diurnal patterns across different regions and climate zones. To identify and explain the drivers of the UHI-HW interactions, we employ machine learning models (CatBoost)  and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework to quantify the contributions of local energy flux, climate background, and land surface characteristics. We found that the UHI-HW interaction, which peaks at 6 AM local time,  is more positive at night than during daytime. We also identified local sensible heat flux, 10-m wind, and urban-rural contrasts in net longwave radiation as the significant drivers of the interaction. However, some drivers behave differently in different Köppen–Geiger climate zones. Our study provides new insights into the complex interaction between UHIs and heat waves, with implications for urban climate adaptation strategies in a warming world. The machine learning-based approach offers a novel means of attributing the spatial variability in UHI-heat wave interactions to specific biophysical drivers.  


Based on this information, create a detailed outline for the paper. Your outline should include the following main sections:

1. Introduction
