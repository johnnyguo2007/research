First, carefully read and consider the following research context:

UHI and heatwave interaction

Now, you will address the following specific query:

how 2m specific humidity is contributing to UHI.

To effectively analyze the factors contributing to UHI:

1. Why 2m specific humidty contributes negatively to UHI



2. Explains how these factors interact and influence each other. Also seperate out the discussion between Day and night.

3. Discusses the potential implications of these interactions on urban climate. Also seperate out the discussion between Day and night.

Present your analysis and insights in a clear, well-structured format. Use scientific terminology appropriate for a climate scientist, but ensure your explanations are coherent and logical.

Write your response within tags. Begin with an overview of the key factors, followed by a detailed discussion of each factor and its interactions. Conclude with a summary of the most critical points and any recommendations for further research.
