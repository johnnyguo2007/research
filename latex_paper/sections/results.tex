\subsection*{Global and regional patterns of UHI-HW interactions }The global simulation results show a clear hourly temporal pattern for the synergy of UHI and HWs. The NW-NHW UHI exhibits a peak at around 05 to 06 and a trough at 09 to 10 local solar time. It also shows a local peak at around 19 local solar time (Figure~\ref{fig:global_diurnal_uhi_hw_interaction}). Aggregating to the diurnal level, we found the nighttime average  \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI 0.27 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.23 \ensuremath{^\circ}C (mean \ensuremath{\pm} 1 s.d.) is higher than its daytime counterpart 0.02\ensuremath{\pm} 0.22\ensuremath{^\circ}C, even though neither result is statistically significant from zero (P {\textgreater} 0.05 for both cases). The results are consistent with previous findings, where positive \unskip~\cite{2755510:33598935,2755510:33598909,2755510:33598908,2755510:33598952} , insignificant\unskip~\cite{2755510:33598915} , and negative \unskip~\cite{2755510:33598943,2755510:33598907,2755510:33598905,2755510:33598896}  \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI were reported, depending on the regions studied.

Figure~\ref{fig:geographical_day_night_duhi} reveals spatial patterns in \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI globally. During the day, notable spatial heterogeneity is observed. Negative or near-neutral interactions are widespread across global coastal areas, major humid mid-latitude agricultural zones, such as the US Corn Belt and Western and Central Europe, and low-latitude tropical regions, including the Congo Basin, Southeast Asia, and southern Mexico. In contrast, distinct positive synergies are clustered within the Indo-Gangetic and North China Plains. At night, the interaction is much stronger and the spatial pattern is more uniform, with the most pronounced hotspot (0.8 \ensuremath{^\circ}C) over northern India. Neutral or slightly negative signals are limited to isolated equatorial grids.

The geographically-bound patterns observed in Figure~\ref{fig:geographical_day_night_duhi}  show notable alignment with the K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger climate classification map\unskip~\cite{2755510:33598889}  (Supplementary Figure 1). For example, a distinct negative interaction over the Congo Basin matches the boundaries of the Af (Tropical Rainforest) climate zone. Similar correspondence is evident in regions such as Western Europe, Northeast China, Northern India, Southeast Asia, and the Southeastern United States. The observed agreement between UHI-HW interaction patterns and established climate zones indicates the importance and utility of conducting subsequent analyses stratified by climate classifications.

In this study, we excluded locations belonging to the Polar K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger climate zone\unskip~\cite{2755510:33598889} . Across the other four major K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger climate zones, the \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI exhibits a similar hourly temporal pattern to the global one, with early morning peaks and late morning troughs (Figure~\ref{fig:diurnal_duhi_by_climate_zone} ). The continental climate zone has the most significant positive peak synergy, while tropical climates have the lowest. Notably, the tropical climate zone is characterized by a significantly higher variance in \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI for both daytime and nighttime, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:duhi_variance_by_climate_zone}.

To explore why tropical climates exhibit more significant variability in \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI than arid climates, this study examined the relationship between \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI and moisture-related factors\ensuremath{^{}}. Because heatwave events are defined as lasting for three or more consecutive days\ensuremath{^{}}, it is possible to analyze the evolution of the UHI-HW interaction for each day throughout an event. This reveals the relationship between environmental conditions and \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI as heatwaves progress. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:daily_evolution_duhi_by_climate} , which plots these concurrent changes, Tropical regions begin with high humidity and soil moisture (normalized q\ensuremath{_{a}}\ensuremath{\approx } 0.8, \ensuremath{\theta }\ensuremath{_{10cm}}\noindent \ensuremath{\approx }1.0)\ensuremath{^{}}. These conditions promote rural evapotranspiration and cooling, resulting in an initial \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI of around 0.4\ensuremath{^\circ}C\ensuremath{^{}}. As heatwaves persist, moisture depletion reduces latent heat flux, shifting energy toward sensible heat and reducing rural cooling\unskip~\cite{2755510:33598930,2755510:33598950,2755510:33598927} . Accordingly, \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI increases to around  0.9\ensuremath{^\circ}C to 1.0\ensuremath{^\circ}C, indicating the rural cooling effect gradually diminishes as the heatwave prolongs. Conversely, arid climates begin with minimal moisture (normalized q\ensuremath{_{a}} = 0.05, \ensuremath{\theta }\ensuremath{_{10cm}} \ensuremath{\approx } 0.0), maintaining low latent heat flux. Thus, \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI initially is low ({\texttildeapprox}0.15\ensuremath{^\circ}C) and remains relatively stable (0.05\ensuremath{^\circ}C{\textendash}0.10\ensuremath{^\circ}C), with minimal variation throughout the heatwave due to the absence of significant moisture-driven cooling.  Abundant moisture and its change patterns lead to fluctuations of \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI in tropical areas, while limited moisture in arid regions results in stable, minimal variability.

The SHAP waterfall plots (Figure~\ref{fig:shap_waterfall_day_night}) and summary plots (Figure~\ref{fig:shap_summary_day_night}) provide complementary insights into feature group contributions. A feature group consists of all variables of the same metric. The only feature group with more than one feature is q\ensuremath{_{a}}, including both \ensuremath{\Delta }\ensuremath{\delta }q\ensuremath{_{a}} and \ensuremath{\Delta }q\ensuremath{_{a}}. The individual feature's feature importance (Supplementary Figure 1) and summary plots(Supplementary Figure 2) are included in the supplementary material. The summary plots reveal the distribution and directionality of individual feature impacts (positive or negative influence on \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI). \mbox{}\protect\newline In contrast, the waterfall plots quantify the cumulative contribution of each feature to a specific model prediction. A detailed directional contribution analysis will be provided in the discussion section. Net longwave radiation is the most influential factor across daytime(28.20\%) and nighttime(36.47\%) conditions. Sensible heat flux also has consistently high contributions (day: 12.467\%; night: 21.00\%). Specific humidity significantly contributes (19.50\%) during the daytime, while the 10-meter wind is more prominent (16.16\%) at nighttime.

A more granular temporal analysis, as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:global_hourly_shap_contributions}, is important for understanding their dynamics throughout the full diurnal cycle. It illustrates the global hourly cycle of mean SHAP value contributions for these drivers, revealing that their influence is not static. For instance, net longwave radiation (Ln\noindent ) exhibits a positive contribution to the UHI-HW interaction, peaking around 6-7 AM local time and again with a smaller peak around 7-8 PM local time. In contrast, its contribution becomes negative during midday. The influence of specific humidity (q\ensuremath{_{a}}) peaks in the late morning and midday. These detailed hourly patterns, which would be obscured if relying solely on the broader daytime and nighttime averages where the mean \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI was found to be 0.27\ensuremath{\pm}0.23\ensuremath{^\circ}C at night versus 0.02\ensuremath{\pm}0.22\ensuremath{^\circ}C during the day, are essential. Such granularity allows for linking driver influence to the observed overall \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI peaks, such as the one around 5 to 6 AM local time, and troughs, like the one at 9 to 10 AM local time Figure~\ref{fig:global_diurnal_uhi_hw_interaction}. Understanding these specific hourly contributions and transition periods is, therefore, essential for understanding how each variable contributes to the direction of \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI changes.

Figure~\ref{fig:global_hourly_key_feature_shap} and the SHAP summaries in Figure~\ref{fig:shap_summary_day_night}  clarify two important aspects for each driver: whether it enhances or diminishes the \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI and whether changes in its feature values positively or negatively correlate with the SHAP contribution. For net infrared radiation (\ensuremath{\Delta }\ensuremath{\delta }L\ensuremath{_{n}}), larger values consistently correspond to increased positive SHAP contributions in Figure~\ref{fig:global_hourly_key_feature_shap}a, and this positive correlation during both daytime and nighttime is confirmed by the red-shaded bars located on the right-hand side of the X-axis (feature values) in Figure~\ref{fig:shap_summary_day_night}. Similarly, sensible heat flux (\ensuremath{\Delta }SH) provides a positive contribution during the day and a negative contribution during the night(Figure~\ref{fig:global_hourly_key_feature_shap}b). Its SHAP value contribution and feature values generally move in the same direction. Specific humidity (\ensuremath{\Delta }\ensuremath{\delta }q\ensuremath{_{a}}) primarily contributes positively to the UHI from late morning to afternoon(Figure~\ref{fig:global_hourly_key_feature_shap}c). Notably, the SHAP values increase as \ensuremath{\Delta }\ensuremath{\delta }q\ensuremath{_{a}} decreases, indicating a clear negative correlation, which is also confirmed in Figure~\ref{fig:shap_summary_day_night}. The 10 m wind speed (\ensuremath{\Delta }U10) exerts a negative contribution during the night, with SHAP contributions going opposite the change in wind speed values. \ensuremath{\Delta }U10 generally contributes positively during the daytime, though the correlation between feature values and SHAP contribution is less distinct, as observed in Figure~\ref{fig:shap_summary_day_night}  as well.

\subsection*{Regional attribution by the hour}To investigate the regional influences of feature groups, we reutilized the trained CatBoost model. We partitioned the resulting SHAP value contributions into four K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger climate zones: Arid, Continental, Temperate, and Tropical. Figure~\ref{fig:feature_contribution_by_climate_zone}  illustrates the percentage contribution of each feature group to the predicted \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI within each climate zone.  It reveals several patterns. Net longwave radiation(L\ensuremath{_{n}}) consistently emerges as the most influential factor across all K{\"{o}}ppen{\textendash}Geiger climate zones. Its importance nearly doubles from daytime (around 25{\textendash}30\%) to nighttime (35{\textendash}44\%), highlighting the dominant role of radiative cooling during the nighttime.

Across all studied climate zones during the day ( Figure~\ref{fig:feature_contribution_by_climate_zone} Daytime), aside from L\ensuremath{_{n}}, Specific humidity (q\ensuremath{_{a}}) and 10-meter wind (U10) emerge as dominant contributors to the model's predictions, which is consistent with Figure~\ref{fig:shap_waterfall_day_night}a. The tropical climate is characterized by significant contributions from 2-m specific humidity (q\ensuremath{_{a}}). In this zone, qa contributes much more than any other climate zone. Again, compared to contributions in other climate zones, 10-meter wind (U10, 21\%) has the highest contribution in the arid zone.

At night, the order of importance changes: sensible heat flux (SH) becomes much more impactful and pronounced in continental climates, where SH approaches 23\%. Humidity has smaller contribution after sunset across all climate zones.

Figure~\ref{fig:q2m_shap_by_climate_zone}   provides a detailed examination of the role of 2-m specific humidity (q\ensuremath{_{a}}) and illustrates its varying impact on \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI across different climate zones. This particular variable is selected because its interaction with \ensuremath{\Delta }UHI has been extensively documented\unskip~\cite{2755510:33598930,2755510:33598952,2755510:33598945,2755510:33598947} . This analysis can help validate previous findings by applying the current framework. 

In Arid zones (Figure~\ref{fig:q2m_shap_by_climate_zone} a), \ensuremath{\Delta }\ensuremath{\delta }qa is generally small and hovers near zero or is slightly positive during the late afternoon and night. It started to turn negative from morning to noon. Correspondingly, the SHAP contribution of q\ensuremath{_{a\ }}in Arid zones is predominantly negative from the morning to noon. However, its SHAP contribution impact is the smallest among the four climate zones studied. It is the only climate zone that shows a material negative contribution during the night. Continental (Figure~\ref{fig:q2m_shap_by_climate_zone} b), Temperate (Figure~\ref{fig:q2m_shap_by_climate_zone} c), and Tropical (Figure~\ref{fig:q2m_shap_by_climate_zone} d) climate zones consistently show negative \ensuremath{\Delta }\ensuremath{\delta }q\ensuremath{_{a}} values. These values indicate drier atmospheric conditions during heatwaves compared to non-heatwave periods in urban areas. A key observation in these four zones is a sharp drop in \ensuremath{\Delta }\ensuremath{\delta }q\ensuremath{_{a}} around the sunrise period (approximately 5-7 AM local time). Concurrently, there is a sharp increase in the positive SHAP contribution of q\ensuremath{_{a}} during this same sunrise period across these zones, with the Tropical zone (Figure~\ref{fig:q2m_shap_by_climate_zone} d) exhibiting the most significant positive SHAP contribution from q\ensuremath{_{a}}.
